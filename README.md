# GalaxyWatchFaces
This is a repository of any custom Galaxy Watch faces I make. You will need Galaxy Watch Studio in order to use these. THESE WILL NOT WORK WITH WEAROS WATCHES

## Terminal
A watch face designed to look like a terminal window in Ubuntu. There are a few features to note:
- Tapping the battery information will pull up battery status
- Tapping the date or day will pull up the calander
- Tapping the time will bring up alarm
- Doubble tapping anywhere else will open Find My Phone
